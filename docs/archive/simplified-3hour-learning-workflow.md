# Simplified 3-Hour Learning Workflow
**Based on Technical Content Strategy Research Analysis**

## Core Philosophy: Interleaved Learning Model

**Research Finding**: Theory snippet → practical demonstration → theory refinement → extended practice  
**Why it works**: Balances cognitive load with tangible progress, preventing information overload and shallow understanding

## Hour 1: Discovery Phase (Concept Foundation)

### **Structure: Problem/Promise Hook + Interleaved Learning**

#### **Opening Hook (5 minutes)**
- **Problem Statement**: "I'm struggling with [specific concept]"
- **Promise**: Clear learning objective and timeframe
- **Example**: "I have no idea what MCP protocol is or why it's different from REST APIs. In the next hour, I'll build a clear mental model and be ready to code."

#### **Interleaved Discovery Cycles (45 minutes)**
**15-minute cycles × 3, each following this pattern:**

**Cycle 1: Basic Understanding**
- **Theory Snippet** (5 min): Ask key questions, get explanations
- **Practical Demo** (7 min): Draw concept in Miro with AI guidance
- **Understanding Test** (3 min): Explain concept back to AI, get feedback

**Cycle 2: Architecture Understanding** 
- **Theory Refinement** (5 min): Deeper questions about structure/patterns
- **Visual Building** (7 min): Expand Miro diagram with architecture
- **Connection Test** (3 min): Connect to existing knowledge, analogies

**Cycle 3: Implementation Readiness**
- **Extended Theory** (5 min): Practical implementation considerations
- **Complete Diagram** (7 min): Finalize visual mental model
- **Readiness Assessment** (3 min): Can you explain it to a beginner?

#### **Session Wrap-up (10 minutes)**
- **Mental Model Confirmation**: Clean, complete explanation
- **Implementation Preview**: Foreshadow Hour 2 coding approach
- **Content Preparation**: Key insights captured for content creation

### **Success Criteria for Hour 1**
- [ ] Can explain concept in 2-3 clear sentences
- [ ] Visual diagram shows complete understanding
- [ ] Ready to start coding without confusion
- [ ] Hook and key insights ready for content creation

## Hour 2: Implementation Phase (Coding Mastery)

### **Structure: Incremental Building + Active Learning**

#### **Quick Concept Recap (5 minutes)**
- Review key insights from Hour 1
- Show Miro diagram for reference
- Set coding session objectives

#### **Progressive Repetition Practice (45 minutes)**
**Research Finding**: 3 guided → 4 semi-guided → 3 independent reps for optimal skill acquisition

**Guided Practice (15 minutes - Reps 1-3)**
- **Rep 1**: Follow along exactly, understand each line
- **Rep 2**: Pause-and-predict approach, AI prompts before showing
- **Rep 3**: Slight variation, same pattern with different parameters

**Semi-Guided Practice (15 minutes - Reps 4-7)**  
- **Rep 4-5**: AI gives objectives, you implement, get feedback
- **Rep 6-7**: Add complexity, handle edge cases, debug issues

**Independent Practice (15 minutes - Reps 8-10)**
- **Rep 8-9**: Build from memory, reference only when stuck
- **Rep 10**: "Teaching rep" - build while explaining out loud

#### **Polished Tutorial Recording (10 minutes)**
- **Clean Implementation**: Best practices from all 10 reps
- **Clear Narration**: Walk through line-by-line with purpose
- **Error Handling**: Show debugging process and solutions

### **Success Criteria for Hour 2**
- [ ] Can build implementation from memory
- [ ] Understand each component's purpose
- [ ] Polished version ready for content
- [ ] Comfortable explaining the process

## Hour 3: Content Creation Phase (Multi-Format Output)

### **Structure: Research-Based Content Optimization**

#### **Content Planning (10 minutes)**
- **Highlight Extraction**: Review breakthrough moments from Hours 1-2
- **Format Planning**: Determine which insights work best for each format
- **Hook Refinement**: Craft engaging openings for each content type

#### **Multi-Format Creation (45 minutes)**

**Short-Form Content (15 minutes)**
- **Hook**: High-energy problem/solution teaser
- **Key Insight**: 1-2 breakthrough moments from session
- **Call to Action**: Link to full tutorial
- **Format**: 60-second rapid-fire style with visual highlights

**Long-Form Tutorial (20 minutes)**  
- **Professional Edit**: Clean up Hour 2 recording
- **Timestamps**: Clear navigation for key concepts
- **Subtitles/Notes**: Key points for accessibility
- **Structure**: Problem → Concept → Implementation → Summary

**Written Article (10 minutes)**
- **SEO-Optimized Title**: Based on concept breakthrough
- **Technical Deep-Dive**: Code examples with explanations  
- **Learning Journey**: Authentic discovery process
- **Resources**: Links to further learning

#### **Distribution Preparation (5 minutes)**
- **Platform Optimization**: Tailor for YouTube, LinkedIn, Medium
- **Cross-Promotion**: Link between formats for maximum reach
- **Community Engagement**: Prepare for comments and questions

### **Success Criteria for Hour 3**
- [ ] Short-form content ready for immediate posting
- [ ] Long-form tutorial polished and uploaded
- [ ] Written article published with proper SEO
- [ ] Cross-platform distribution scheduled
