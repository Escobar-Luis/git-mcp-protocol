- Generate START-HERE.md with current deliverable focus
- Create docs/ directory with templates
- Set up content tracking system
- Configure bookmark system integration

### 3. Session Management Setup
- Initialize session state management
- Configure privacy and security settings
- Set up automated content extraction
- Enable live streaming safety measures

### 4. Custom Commands Installation
- Install project-specific commands
- Configure command permissions and tools
- Set up deliverable progression automation
- Enable content generation pipeline

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Initialize new deliverable
/project-setup --deliverable mcp-protocol-discovery --session start

# Resume existing deliverable  
/project-setup --deliverable mcp-server-implementation --session resume

# Quick setup for content creation
/project-setup --deliverable content-only --session start
```

## Quality Gates

I'll use Context7 to research your topic and prepare guided questions:

```bash
# For MCP Protocol discovery
Context7 Query: "MCP Model Context Protocol fundamentals client server architecture"
Research Focus: Basic concepts, architecture patterns, practical implementation
```

### 2. Interactive Learning Flow

**Question Sequence Generation:**
- Start with fundamental concepts
- Progress to practical applications
- Include common misconceptions
- End with implementation readiness

**Breakthrough Moment Detection:**
- Track "aha!" moments in conversation
- Identify when concepts click
- Note practical understanding milestones
- Record implementation readiness signals

### 3. Content Generation Preparation

**Real-time Content Outline:**
- Key insights for tutorial structure
- Technical explanations for blog posts
- Social media highlight moments
- Code examples for repositories

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Deep interactive discovery
/guide-discovery --topic mcp-protocol-fundamentals --interactive --depth deep

# Quick concept check  
/guide-discovery --topic git-integration-patterns --depth surface

# Content-focused discovery
/guide-discovery --topic protocol-engineering --interactive --content-ready
```

## Interactive Features

### Question Flow
1. **Foundational Understanding**: "What do you think MCP protocol solves?"
2. **Concept Building**: "How would you explain client-server vs traditional APIs?"
3. **Practical Application**: "What Git operations would benefit from MCP?"
4. **Implementation Readiness**: "Can you describe the basic server structure?"

### Progress Tracking
- Understanding level (beginner â†’ competent â†’ ready)
- Breakthrough moments with timestamps
- Content readiness assessment
- Next deliverable preparation

The guide ensures authentic learning while preparing high-quality content automatically.
```

### 4. Session Management Command

#### File: `.claude/commands/start-session.md`
```yaml
---
allowed-tools:
  - Write(.claude/session-state.json)
  - Bash(/bookmark *)
  - Edit(START-HERE.md)
argument-hint: [--deliverable name] [--private] [--resume session-id]
description: Initialize or resume learning session with bookmark integration

# Session Management with Bookmark Integration

Initialize or resume learning session for $ARGUMENTS with automated tracking and content preparation.

## Session Initialization

### 1. Session State Creation
I'll create comprehensive session tracking:

```json
{
  "session_id": "generated-uuid",
  "project": "git-mcp-protocol",
  "deliverable": "mcp-protocol-discovery", 
  "started": "2025-08-25T14:30:00Z",
  "privacy_mode": true,
  "bookmark_integration": true,
  "content_tracking": {
    "highlights": [],
    "breakthroughs": [],
    "questions": [],
    "implementation_progress": {}
  }
}
```

### 2. Bookmark System Integration
**Automated Bookmark Setup:**
- Generate session ID for bookmark tracking
- Configure OBS timestamp capture
- Set up highlight moment detection
- Enable privacy protection for streams

### 3. Deliverable Focus Setup
**START-HERE.md Update:**
- Current deliverable highlighted
- Progress indicators updated
- Next steps clarified
- Success criteria refreshed

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Start new private session
/start-session --deliverable mcp-protocol-discovery --private

# Resume existing session
/start-session --resume abc123-def456

# Quick content session
/start-session --deliverable content-creation --private
```

## Privacy and Security

**Automatic Privacy Protection:**
- Environment variables hidden from streams
- API keys blurred or redacted
- Sensitive data automatically protected
- Private repository information secured

**Stream Safety:**
- OBS scene configuration for privacy
- Terminal output sanitization
- Screen sharing safety checks
- Automated content warnings

The session management ensures seamless learning with comprehensive tracking and content generation support.
```

## Command Integration Patterns

### Cross-Command Communication
```json
{
  "sessionState": ".claude/session-state.json",
  "bookmarkIntegration": "~/.claude/bookmarks/{project}/",
  "contentGeneration": "content-generated/",
  "progressTracking": "docs/progress-tracking.md"
}
```

### Error Handling and Recovery
```bash
# Command failure recovery
if command_failed; then
  log_error_with_context
  preserve_session_state  
  prompt_user_for_manual_action
  provide_recovery_options
fi
```

### Quality Gates and Validation
```bash
# Pre-execution validation
validate_environment_setup
check_required_permissions
verify_integration_endpoints
confirm_user_preferences

# Post-execution verification  
validate_outputs_generated
check_content_quality
verify_session_state_updated
confirm_next_steps_ready
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **project-setup.md** - Essential for eliminating friction
2. **guide-discovery.md** - Core learning automation
3. **start-session.md** - Session and bookmark integration
4. **extract-content.md** - Content generation pipeline

These commands will transform the current friction-heavy process into a smooth, automated workflow that maintains authentic learning while generating high-quality content automatically.

**Next**: Implement these commands before continuing MCP server development to validate the automated workflow approach.
