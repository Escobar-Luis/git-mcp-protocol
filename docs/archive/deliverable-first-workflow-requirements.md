# Deliverable-First Workflow Requirements

**Context**: Framework redesign based on Project 1.1 implementation discoveries  
**Purpose**: Define exact specifications for automated workflow and content creation  

## Core Philosophy Shift

**From**: Implementation-driven learning (build ‚Üí document ‚Üí create content)  
**To**: Deliverable-driven learning (define content ‚Üí learn through creation ‚Üí automate process)

## Deliverable Structure for MCP Protocol Project

### Primary Content Deliverables

#### 1. **"What is MCP Protocol?" Discovery Video**
- **Raw Session**: Live discovery with genuine confusion and breakthrough moments
- **Polished Tutorial**: 10-15 minute edited explanation  
- **Short-form Content**: 60-second reel with key insights
- **Written Content**: Blog post with technical deep-dive

#### 2. **"Building My First MCP Server" Implementation Video** 
- **Raw Session**: Live coding from scratch with debugging
- **Polished Tutorial**: Step-by-step walkthrough
- **Code Repository**: Educational GitHub repo with commit history
- **Documentation**: Implementation guide with lessons learned

#### 3. **"Git + MCP Integration" Problem-Solving Video**
- **Raw Session**: Live problem-solving of connecting Git to MCP protocol
- **Polished Tutorial**: Solution walkthrough with architecture explanation
- **Technical Article**: Protocol engineering insights
- **Reference Implementation**: Production-ready code example

## Automated Workflow Specifications

### Project Start Automation

#### Custom Command: `/project-start`
```bash
# Usage: /project-start --deliverable "what-is-mcp-protocol"

# Automated actions:
1. Initialize session with bookmark system
2. Generate START-HERE.md with deliverable focus
3. Set up live streaming environment (privacy-conscious)
4. Create initial file structure
5. Configure custom commands for project
6. Initialize content tracking system
```

#### START-HERE.md Template
```markdown
# Project 1.1: Git + MCP Protocol Implementation

## üéØ Current Deliverable: Understanding MCP Protocol

**What you're creating today**: "What is MCP Protocol?" discovery content
**Content outputs**: Raw session, polished tutorial, technical article, social posts
**Time estimate**: 45-60 minutes discovery + 30 minutes content creation

### Discovery Process
Run: `/guide-discovery --topic "mcp-protocol-fundamentals"`

This will:
- Guide you through Context7 research
- Ask the right questions for learning
- Track your breakthrough moments
- Generate content automatically

### Questions to Explore
- What makes MCP different from REST APIs?
- How does client-host-server architecture work?
- What are tools vs resources in MCP?
- Why is this called "protocol-native" development?

### Session Tracking
- Bookmark: `/bookmark $(get-session-id) "Started MCP protocol discovery"`
- Auto-highlights: Enabled for content extraction
- Privacy mode: API keys and sensitive data hidden

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Commands

**Initialize Environment**: `/setup-mcp-project`  
**Start Recording**: `/start-session --private --deliverable mcp-protocol`  
**Begin Discovery**: `/guide-discovery --interactive`  

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] Can explain MCP protocol in 2-3 sentences
- [ ] Understand client-host-server pattern
- [ ] Know difference between tools and resources  
- [ ] Have working knowledge for implementation phase
- [ ] Content recorded and ready for editing

---
**Next Deliverable**: "Building My First MCP Server" (automated setup ready)
```

### Content Creation Automation

#### Custom Command: `/guide-discovery`
```bash
# Usage: /guide-discovery --topic "mcp-protocol-fundamentals" --interactive

# Automated flow:
1. Research topic via Context7
2. Generate guided questions
3. Track user responses and breakthroughs
4. Identify "move the needle" moments
5. Generate content outlines automatically
6. Create social media variants
```

#### Custom Command: `/extract-content` 
```bash
# Usage: /extract-content --session $(get-session-id) --format all

# Automated processing:
1. Parse bookmark data from session
2. Identify breakthrough moments from timestamps
3. Extract conversation context from JSONL
4. Generate multiple content formats:
   - YouTube script with timestamps
   - Blog post with technical details
   - LinkedIn post with insights
   - Twitter thread with key points
   - Instagram reel script with visual cues
```

## Content Strategy Integration

### Multi-Format Content Pipeline

#### Raw Learning Documentation
- **Live Stream**: Complete discovery process with genuine learning
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Automated via bookmark system
- **Privacy Protection**: API keys and sensitive data automatically hidden
- **Highlight Detection**: AI-powered identification of breakthrough moments

#### Polished Content Generation
```javascript
// Content generation pipeline
const contentPipeline = {
  input: {
    rawVideo: "obs-recording.mp4",
    timestamps: "bookmark-data.json", 
    conversation: "session-conversation.jsonl"
  },
  processing: {
    highlights: extractHighlights(timestamps),
    insights: analyzeBreakthroughs(conversation),
    visuals: generateDiagrams(codeChanges)
  },
  outputs: {
    youtube: generateTutorialScript(highlights, insights),
    blog: generateTechnicalArticle(conversation, insights),
    social: generateSocialContent(highlights),
    repo: generateEducationalRepo(codeChanges)
  }
};
```

### Content Quality Standards

#### Technical Accuracy
- All code examples must work
- Architecture diagrams must be accurate
- Explanations must be beginner-friendly but technically correct
- Links and references must be valid

#### Educational Value
- Clear learning progression
- Authentic problem-solving process
- Mistake documentation and recovery
- Practical implementation focus

#### Production Quality
- Professional editing and pacing
- Consistent branding and style
- Optimized for platform (YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.)
- SEO-optimized titles and descriptions

## Privacy and Security Requirements

### Live Streaming Safety
```bash
# Environment variable protection
export STREAM_MODE=private
export HIDE_SECRETS=true
export BLUR_TERMINALS=false  # Only for setup commands

# Automated content sanitization
/sanitize-stream --hide-keys --blur-secrets --safe-mode
```

### API Key Management
- Environment variables automatically hidden during streams
- .env files excluded from screen sharing
- API responses sanitized before display
- Credential rotation after public streams

### Data Privacy
- Session data encrypted at rest
- Personal information automatically redacted
- Code examples sanitized for public release
- Conversation transcripts privacy-filtered

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Bookmark System Enhancement
```json
{
  "deliverableTracking": {
    "currentDeliverable": "mcp-protocol-discovery",
    "progressMarkers": [
      {"timestamp": "00:15:30", "event": "First MCP explanation attempt"},
      {"timestamp": "00:32:45", "event": "Client-server pattern breakthrough"},
      {"timestamp": "00:48:20", "event": "First working tool registration"}
    ],
    "contentReadiness": {
      "tutorial": 85,
      "blog": 70,
      "social": 95
