## Hour 1: MCP Protocol Discovery Workflow

### **Objective**: Build Clear Mental Model of MCP Architecture Through Interleaved Learning

#### **Opening Hook (5 minutes)**
**Research Finding**: Problem/Promise hooks maximize engagement and set clear learning objectives

**MCP-Specific Process**:
1. **State the Problem**: "I have no idea what MCP Protocol is - is it just another API standard?"
2. **Set the Promise**: "In the next hour, I'll understand MCP architecture and be ready to build a server"  
3. **Define Success**: "I should be able to explain MCP vs REST APIs and draw the architecture"
4. **Start Recording**: Begin live session with bookmark timestamp

**MCP-Specific Questions to Explore**:
- What problem does MCP Protocol solve that REST APIs don't?
- How does client-host-server architecture actually work?
