# My MCP Protocol Discovery Session

**Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Goal**: Understand what MCP Protocol actually is and create multi-format content  
**Status**: Live streaming this learning process

## My Initial Understanding (Before Discovery)

"My current understanding of MCP protocol right now is that it's a standardized approach between all agents, so we don't have to write a custom bridge between all agents to the same service. MCP provides a standardized way to connect any agent to any service, meaning it's reusable across all agents; it's not like every agent needs its own config."

**Problems I thought MCP solved:**
- Connection errors
- Permissions (agents shouldn't edit/delete everything)

**My confusion:** "I don't really get it. Show me like why it matters, when else would I use it outside of this project? Like, what are the common use cases that I'll come across, when I would need to create a MCP? I see the usage like Context7 MCP that fetches documentation, that's useful, but I don't get how this Git MCP is going to prove to be useful."

## The Breakthrough Question That Changed Everything

**The question:** "If I add an MCP client to each agent, isn't that the same thing as a custom logic to connect from the diagram on the left and defeats its purpose?"

This question broke my understanding wide open.

## Key Insights Discovered

### 1. The NÃ—M Integration Problem
**Without MCP:** 5 agents Ã— 2 tools = 10 custom integrations  
**With MCP:** 5 generic clients + 2 specialized servers = 7 components

The math is simple, but the implications are huge.

### 2. Generic vs Specific - The Core Distinction
- **MCP Client**: Generic protocol code (like a USB port) - same for every agent
- **MCP Server**: Tool-specific logic (Git commands, DB queries, API calls)

**My realization:** "The MCP client doesn't know Git commands. The Git MCP server does. The client just speaks MCP protocol."

### 3. Language-Specific but Generic
The MCP client will be rewritten according to what the application's native language is:
- React frontend â†’ JavaScript MCP client
- Java backend â†’ Java MCP client
- Python AI â†’ Python MCP client

But the LOGIC is the same - they all just speak MCP protocol.

### 4. Authentication Revelation 
**My initial wrong thinking:** "Every agent will still need their own authentication, that's not going to be centralized."

**The reality:** Authentication is stored in the MCP SERVER, not the client!
- Git MCP Server stores GitHub tokens
- Database MCP Server stores DB credentials
- 5 agents share 1 set of credentials per service

This flips it from NÃ—M authentication (every agent needs every credential) to N+M (agents connect to servers that manage credentials).

## MCP vs REST API Comparison

**Authentication & Security:**
- REST: Each agent stores JWT tokens/API keys for each service
- MCP: One server stores credentials, all agents share through the server

**API Versioning:**
- REST: GitHub changes v3â†’v4, update every agent's documentation
- MCP: Update the Git MCP server, all agents automatically get the changes

**Discovery:**
- REST: New agent needs documentation for every API
- MCP: New agent connects to server, gets capabilities automatically

**Real-time Communication - BREAKTHROUGH UNDERSTANDING:**
**REST = PULL ONLY:** Agent constantly asks "any new commits?" - wasteful polling
**MCP = PUSH + PULL:** Server can say "ðŸ”” Hey! New commit happened!" - instant notifications

My insight: "A key difference is that for REST API, it's usually like we have to pull it. I can't think of a scenario when the API talks to our service. Whereas for MCP protocol, it can actually talk to my agent, so the agent doesn't have to always check the server."

The notification logic is still "custom" (encoded into each MCP server), but it's CENTRALIZED instead of duplicated across all agents.

## Current Questions Still Need Answers

1. âœ… **SOLVED:** Bidirectional communication works through webhooks/WebSockets to MCP server, then server pushes to all connected agents
2. What does the actual message flow look like? (JSON-RPC 2.0 format)
3. How do I implement this practically?

## My Complete Teaching Test Explanation

"MCP is a standardized protocol which solves the NÃ—M problem of multiple agents Ã— multiple config files to access REST APIs. Every agent has a language-specific MCP client (JavaScript for React, Java for backends) that connects to servers containing all API connection information. The server acts as a wrapper over REST APIs, centralizing authentication so one API key serves all agents instead of each agent needing individual credentials.

The server houses actions (tools like git-commit) and resources (data access like repository status). When an agent calls a tool, the server translates MCP calls to REST API calls, makes the request, and translates responses back to MCP format.

For bidirectional communication, the server uses webhooks/WebSockets to get real-time notifications from services, then pushes those notifications to all connected agents. For example, when a team member commits, GitHub webhooks notify the MCP server, which instantly alerts all team agents - no polling needed.

**Advanced Understanding:** MCP servers are universal integration hubs that wrap ANY type of service using whatever communication method that service supports best. A single service might use multiple methods - GitHub uses REST APIs for actions (create commit) AND webhooks for events (notify about commits). The server acts as a polyglot translator, speaking REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets, or any other protocol the underlying service requires."

## MCP Server Architecture & Communication Methods

### Interview-Relevant Knowledge
**Senior developer interview questions:** "We have a legacy SQL database, GraphQL API, and Slack integration. How would you design an MCP server for AI agent access?"

**The fundamental architectural pattern I learned:**
1. **What actions** do I want agents to perform on this service?
2. **What events** do I want agents to know about from this service?  
3. **What's the best communication method** for each?

### Most Common Communication Methods (Priority Order)

**1. REST API + Webhooks (90% of cases)**
- Action: HTTP requests to service
- Events: Service POSTs to webhook endpoint
- Why common: Most services support this

**2. Database Connections + Triggers (Very common)**
- Action: Direct SQL queries (predefined tools like `get-user`, `create-order`)
- Events: Database triggers fire notifications when data changes
- Connection Pooling: Multiple agents share database connections efficiently

**3. WebSockets (Growing rapidly)**  
- Both action & events: Bidirectional messaging
- Use cases: Real-time apps (chat, collaboration, gaming)

**4. GraphQL + Subscriptions (Modern apps)**
- Action: GraphQL mutations/queries
- Events: GraphQL subscriptions

### Three Types of Communication
1. **Action Communication**: Client-initiated ("Do this action")
2. **Event Communication**: Service-initiated ("Something happened!")  
3. **Streaming Data**: Continuous flow (logs, metrics, live feeds)

## Real Examples I Already Use

**Context7 MCP:** Already works with Claude Code because Claude has an MCP client built-in. If I switched to Cursor tomorrow, that same Context7 server would work - no new integration needed.

This is the power of the protocol approach.

**Key breakthrough moment:** The question about whether MCP clients are just "custom logic in disguise"

**Visual elements:** Miro diagrams showing NÃ—M problem vs MCP solution

**Authentic struggles:** Voice mode setup failures - real developer workflow friction that's relatable
