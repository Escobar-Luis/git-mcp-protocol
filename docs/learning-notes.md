# Learning Notes: Git + MCP Protocol Implementation

## Implementation Journal

### Day 1 - Project Setup and Initial Development

#### Setup Phase Completed ✅ 
- [x] Template copied and customized for Git + MCP Protocol
- [x] Git repository initialized with initial commit
- [x] Project structure created with MCP protocol foundation
- [x] README.md updated with framework specifications
- [x] package.json customized with MCP-specific dependencies
- [x] docs/deliverables.md updated with protocol compliance criteria
- [x] Framework connection documented
- [ ] GitHub repository created and connected (pending manual creation)
- [ ] Claude set to "guided learning" mode (⚠️ REQUIRED before development)

**Setup Challenges Encountered:**
- **GitHub CLI not available** - requires manual repository creation (HIGH FRICTION - 4/5)
  - *Solution*: Installed GitHub CLI using Homebrew, automated repo creation
  - *Automation potential*: High - can be fully automated in BMAD `/start-project` command
  - *Time savings*: ~15 minutes per project (manual vs automated)
- **Template customization manual** - repetitive text replacement in multiple files (MEDIUM FRICTION - 3/5)
  - *Solution*: Manual editing of README, package.json, docs files
  - *Automation potential*: High - perfect for template parameter substitution
  - *Time savings*: ~10 minutes per project
- **Framework specification lookup** - manual navigation to PROJECT-ROADMAP.md (LOW FRICTION - 2/5)
  - *Solution*: Manual cross-referencing and copying specifications
  - *Automation potential*: Medium - can extract and inject automatically
  - *Time savings*: ~5 minutes per project
- **MCP SDK package availability** - need to verify dependency versions work (TBD)

**Setup Solutions Found:**  
- Automated GitHub CLI installation and repository creation workflow
- Created systematic template customization approach
- Linked framework specifications directly in project documentation
- Prepared validation scripts and testing framework for MCP compliance

**Friction Points to Document During Development:**
- [ ] MCP SDK installation and compatibility issues
- [ ] Protocol specification complexity and learning curve
- [ ] Git integration complexity and debugging
- [ ] AI service integration challenges
- [ ] Testing and validation difficulties
