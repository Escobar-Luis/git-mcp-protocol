# Git + MCP Protocol Implementation - START HERE

## üéØ Your First Deliverable Today

**What you're creating**: "What is MCP Protocol?" concept discovery and explanation  
**Content outputs**: Discovery video, polished tutorial, technical article, social content  
**Time commitment**: 3 hours total  
**End result**: Shareable content ready for job applications + working MCP server knowledge  

---

## üìã Today's 3-Hour Learning Loop

### **Hour 1: Discovery Phase** (MCP Protocol Foundation)
**Goal**: Go from "I have no idea what MCP is" to clear conceptual understanding

**Process**:
1. **Hook Setup** (5 min): "I have no idea what MCP Protocol is or why it's different from REST APIs"
2. **Discovery Cycles** (45 min): 3 √ó 15-minute interleaved learning cycles
   - **Cycle 1**: What is MCP? Basic concepts and problem it solves
   - **Cycle 2**: Client-host-server architecture and how it works
   - **Cycle 3**: Tools vs Resources and implementation readiness
3. **Readiness Check** (10 min): Can you explain MCP to a beginner?

**Success**: Ready to start coding MCP server without confusion

### **Hour 2: Implementation Phase** (MCP Server Mastery) 
**Goal**: Build working MCP server through progressive repetition

**Process**:
1. **Concept Recap** (5 min): Review MCP architecture from Hour 1
2. **Progressive Reps** (45 min): 10 MCP server implementations
   - **Reps 1-3**: Guided (follow MCP SDK patterns exactly)
   - **Reps 4-7**: Semi-guided (build Git tools with feedback)
   - **Reps 8-10**: Independent (complete server from memory)
3. **Polished Tutorial** (10 min): Clean Git + MCP integration for content

**Success**: Can build MCP server from memory and integrate Git operations

### **Hour 3: Content Creation** (Multi-Format Output)
**Goal**: Transform learning into professional content

**Process**:
1. **Content Planning** (10 min): Extract breakthrough moments and plan formats
2. **Multi-Format Creation** (45 min):
   - **Short-form** (15 min): "MCP vs REST API in 60 seconds" reel
   - **Long-form** (20 min): "Building Your First MCP Server" tutorial
   - **Technical article** (10 min): "Git + MCP: Protocol-Native Development"
3. **Distribution Prep** (5 min): Optimize for YouTube, LinkedIn, Medium

**Success**: Content ready to share immediately for job applications

## üîç Specific MCP Learning Questions

### **Hour 1 Discovery Focus**
- What makes MCP different from REST APIs or GraphQL?
- How does client-host-server pattern work in practice?
- What are MCP tools vs resources and when do you use each?
