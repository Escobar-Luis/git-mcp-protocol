# Git + MCP Protocol Implementation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: CLAUDE SETUP REQUIRED BEFORE STARTING
**Set Claude's output style to "guided learning" mode before beginning development**

This ensures:
- Authentic learning experience maintains code ownership
- Prevents over-reliance on AI-generated solutions
- Documents genuine problem-solving process
- Creates valuable learning content

## Project Overview
**Phase 1.1: Git + MCP Protocol Implementation** - Building AI-native Git workflows using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI systems to external data sources and tools.

### Core Objectives
- **Git Workflow Patterns** → Feature branch, GitFlow, GitHub Flow implementation
- **MCP Protocol Architecture** → Client-host-server patterns, tool/resource primitives
- **Protocol Security Models** → OAuth 2.0/2.1 integration, encryption standards  
- **Clean Code Principles** → Protocol-compliant code structure

### AI-Native Deliverables
- Custom MCP server for Git repository intelligence
- AI-powered commit message generation with protocol compliance
- Intelligent branch management with multi-agent coordination
- Protocol-based Git hooks for automated workflow optimization

## Setup Instructions
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-mcp-protocol.git
cd git-mcp-protocol

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run MCP server development mode
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build and start MCP server
npm run build && npm start
```

## Implementation Guide
Based on `../System-Design/01-Framework-Documentation/PROJECT-ROADMAP.md` specifications:

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. **MCP Server Architecture** - Implement client-host-server communication patterns
2. **Git Integration Layer** - Connect MCP protocol to Git repository operations
3. **Security Implementation** - OAuth 2.0/2.1 authentication and authorization

### Phase 2: AI-Enhanced Features  
1. **Intelligent Commit Analysis** - AI-powered commit message generation and validation
2. **Branch Management Automation** - Multi-agent coordination for branch operations
3. **Protocol-based Hooks** - Automated workflow optimization through MCP

### Phase 3: Portfolio Integration
1. **Personal Website Integration** - MCP-enabled Git workflow for portfolio projects
2. **Cross-platform Automation** - Standardized Git operations across development environments

## Success Criteria
Framework-defined deliverables and completion metrics:

### Technical Deliverables
- ✅ Personal portfolio website with MCP-enabled Git workflow
- ✅ Custom MCP server for Git repository intelligence  
- ✅ AI-powered commit analysis with protocol-standard communication
- ✅ Cross-platform Git automation using standardized protocols

### Quality Standards

## Development Phase Guide

### What You'll Actually Build
**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Set Claude to **"guided learning" mode** before starting development

#### Phase 1: MCP Server Foundation (30 minutes)
You'll build a real MCP server from scratch:
- Install and understand MCP SDK dependencies  
- Implement basic server following 2025-06-18 specification
- Set up client-host-server communication patterns
- Handle protocol messages and validation

#### Phase 2: Git Integration (45 minutes)  
Connect your MCP server to Git operations:
- Use simple-git library for repository analysis
- Create MCP tools for Git operations (commit, branch, status)
- Create MCP resources for repository data
- Test Git automation through protocol interface

#### Phase 3: AI-Powered Features (30 minutes)
Add intelligence to your Git workflow:
- AI commit message generation based on staged changes
- Intelligent branch suggestions and management
- Smart Git hooks using MCP protocol
- Portfolio website integration

#### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (15 minutes)
Make it production-ready:
- Validate MCP protocol compliance
- Test all Git integrations
- Document the learning journey
- Prepare for content creation

### BMAD Automation Context
This is **Project 1.1** - the baseline establishment phase. After completing this manually with guided learning:
- Document timing and friction points for automation development
- Use learnings to build BMAD automation for Projects 1.2+
- Maintain authentic learning experience while identifying automation opportunities
